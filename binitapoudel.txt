The 3 days learning experience went amazing.
 This was a completely new topic to me however I got to learn a lot about this topic. 
I'm very much grateful to Milan sir and to GCA and Girls In Tech,Nepal. 
I had a lot of expectations during this session and it happened as I expected.
However it would have been better if the session would lasts for some more days.
I think there are a lot of things still which we are unaware about regarding git and github.
So,I wish next session would lasts for some more days giving us a detailed information regarding that topic.
